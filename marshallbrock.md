 Unit 1 Project Build A Portfolio Site
Overview
This project will give you a chance to use the skills we've learned in class to create a site that highlights the skills and projects you'll be working on in WDI. You'll get a chance to use JavaScript to tackle interactions such as an image slider, a responsive hamburger menu, and quotes that fade in and out on a timer.

Make sure to customize the design and content of the website to make it your own.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you throughout the process and helping as you go.

Requirements
Your work must:

Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS, adhering to best practices.
Use Flexbox to create a multi-column layout.
Must be responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop
Include at least one HTML, one CSS and one JavaScript files.
Stick with the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
Be deployed and accessible online.
Must pull in projects via API call from google sheet (lecture
Necessary Deliverables
An About, Projects, Contact form
Site must be created using a "mobile first" approach.
A Git repository, hosted on your personal GitHub, that includes a link to your hosted site. Site url should be in the form of githubusername.github.io. Read more on setting up github pages
Repo must contain frequent commits (min 15+) dating back to the beginning of the project.
An updated project workshheet will all sections filled out accordingly.
An in-class demo of the site that shows off the interactions you worked on.
Nav bar functionality that allows the page to scroll smoothly to the correspending section when a nav item is clicked.

Finding Good Portfolio Sites To Emulate - 10 min
Search and compare at least 3 profile web sites. Record your findings in the table below and include some aspect of the site that you would like to incorporate into your own site.

Starter Code
No starter code has been provided for this project, as you will be building your site from scratch. As an option, you can use the HTML5 Boilerplate as a template to get started.

Suggested Ways to Get Started
Don't hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short-term problems.
Read the documentation for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time — but not always — there is a tutorial you can follow, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.
Write pseudocode before you write any JavaScript code. Planning out and thinking through interactions for a website is an important step that will save you time and effort when you start actually coding.
Do not simply copy and paste code that you find online! It is OK (and highly encouraged) to use resources like Stack Overflow when thinking through interactions, but use these sites as a guide and then write the code on your own.
Hungry For More?
